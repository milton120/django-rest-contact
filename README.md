# django-rest-contact
 
 A simple django-rest-framework demo
 
 ## Description
 
 The main objective of this project is to learn about django-rest-framework and create a simple API endpoints with CRUD functionality. In this project, I am creating an Contact [API](https://github.com/milton120/django-rest-contact/tree/master/contact/api) from where a user can perform CRUD operations.
 
 ## API endpoints
 
 - **/api/v1/contact**
   - A user will be able to get a list of all the contacts and will be able to
create a new contact using this endpoint.

- **/api/v1/contact/<id>**
    - A user will be able to update and delete a contact using this
endpoint.
